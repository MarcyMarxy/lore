# Lore Board

A Kanban for tracking my learning journey.

## How to Use

1. Create issues for items in the Kanban view
   Or for automated tracking:
   - Create milestones in the repository's Milestones section
   - Create issues within a milestone
2. Add labels
3. Move cards between columns
4. Done items auto-close

## Automation using Project Workflows

- **New issues with milestones** → Auto-added to project
- **Items added to project** → Status set to "Sprint"
- **Status changed to "Done"** → Issue auto-closed

## Project Columns

- Backlog → Sprint → In Progress → Done

## Philosophy

- Visualize Tasks
- Sprint Focus
- Automate the Mundane

*Simple automated tracking for continuous learning.*
